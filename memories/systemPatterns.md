# System Patterns

- Modular tool handler architecture
- Separation of transport, logic, and validation
- Use of MCP SDK for protocol compliance
- Environment-driven config for DB connection
- Logging to stderr to avoid protocol interference
- Planned: DAL abstraction, middleware for auth/rate limiting
