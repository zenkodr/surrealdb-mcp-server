# Active Context

## Date: 2025-05-20

### Context
- Initiated full audit of SurrealDB MCP server codebase for improvements and feature/functionality adds.
- Synchronized with latest SurrealDB/SurrealQL features using Context7.
- No existing `memories/` directory found; creating baseline documentation structure.

### Key Decisions
- Adopt modularization, type safety, and static validation (arktype) for all tool handlers.
- Expose new SurrealDB features (LIVE SELECT, DEFINE FUNCTION, schema/permission management, advanced auth, etc.) via MCP tools.
- Track all improvements, features, and tech debt in `memories/`.

### Next Steps
- Create baseline documentation files in `memories/`.
- Draft prioritized feature/task roadmap.
- Begin code refactor and new tool implementation.
