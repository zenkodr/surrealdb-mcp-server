1. Reproduce the Issue
2. Gather Information
3. Analyze the Data
4. Form Hypotheses
5. Test Hypotheses
6. Implement and Verify
7. Document Findings

### 2.2 Advanced Debugging Techniques

## 3. Effective Development Processes and Methodologies

### 3.1 Agile Development Practices

- Iterative Development
- User Stories
- Backlog Refinement
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Stand-ups
- Sprint Reviews
- Retrospectives

### 3.2 DevOps and Continuous Delivery

- Continuous Integration (CI)

- Monitoring and Observability
- Feature Toggles
- Blameless Culture

### 3.3 Engineering Excellence Practices

- Coding Standards
- Code Reviews
- Pair Programming
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Refactoring
- Documentation

## 4. Code Quality and Maintainability

### 4.1 Clean Code Principles

- Meaningful Names
- Small Functions
- Clear Control Flow
- Comments
- Error Handling
- Formatting

### 4.2 Code Organization

- Logical Cohesion
- Encapsulation
- Dependency Management
- Package Structure
- Inheritance Hierarchies
- Consistent Patterns

### 4.3 Technical Debt Management

- Regular Refactoring
- Debt Tracking
- Boy Scout Rule
- Refactoring Windows
- Quality Gates
- Legacy Code Strategies

### 4.4 Additional Code Quality Practices

- Use PNPM; pin dependencies; make atomic commits.
- Keep code simple and modular (less than 250 lines); use static types; write tests.
- Extract logic by function/domain.
- Verify new dependencies.
- Document technical debt; schedule refactoring.
- For async functions returning promises, use explicit `Promise.resolve()` or `Promise.reject()` when there's no actual asynchronous operation.
- Avoid using the `any` type; use type guards for precise type checking.

## 5. Effective Collaboration and Technical Leadership
