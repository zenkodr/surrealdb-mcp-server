# Research and Documentation Practices

- Always use available MCP tools to research the latest information on technologies, frameworks, and libraries.
- Verify information from multiple sources when possible.
- Never rely solely on your own memory; always verify the latest documentation.
- Document research findings and decisions in 'memories/' files, specifically in `techContext.md` for tech stack details.
- Use Context7 MCP for researching relevant documentation.
- Ensure accuracy and adhere to the latest versions and documentation found in Context7 MCP.
- Always follow the documentation and guidelines provided by Context7 MCP
  - Unless the official documentation is newer or more accurate.
- Be careful with server-side and client-side code distinctions, using 'use client' when necessary.
